title: Structured Light Vision Systems Using a Robust Laser Stripe Segmentation Method
summary: The structured light method may fail with the interference of reflection and scattering of light. We used U-Net to extract the laser region, obtained the center of the laser stripe after erosion and dilation, and finally reconstruct the point cloud corresponding to the laser stripe.
