title: Parking Occupancy Detection Using Computer Vision
summary: Developed the program using Convoluional Neural Networks for parking space classification and counting occupied parking spaces, whose accuracy reached 90%, precision was 96%. We incorporated the mutual information method for image registration and the affine transformation to eliminate the impact caused by camera shake, the robustness of detection was enhanced.
