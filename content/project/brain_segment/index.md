title: Automated Fetal Brain Segmentation Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
summary: Fetal MRI is widely used in normal/abnormal development diagnosis for the gestational age (GA) over 20 weeks. Meanwhile, 3D volume registration reconstruction depends on the performance of fetal brain segmentation. We implemented a customized U-Net for automated fetal brain segmentation. The experiment results were evaluated by commonly used metrics in image segmentation.
