title: DTFT and DFT
subtitle: 

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is the sinc function. The discrete Fourier transform of a rectangular signal after pulse discrete sampling is the Dirichlet function. That is, DTFT is equivalent to FT first, then convolve with the sinc function; DFT is equivalent to FT first, then convolve with the Dirichlet function.
