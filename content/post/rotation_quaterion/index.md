title: Rotation matrix and Quaterion
subtitle: 

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: A quaternion is a four-element vector that can be used to encode any rotation in a 3D coordinate system. Quaternions avoid "gimbal lock" which can result when, for example in pitch/yaw/roll rotational systems, the pitch is rotated 90Â° up or down, so that yaw and roll then correspond to the same motion, and a degree of freedom of rotation is lost.
