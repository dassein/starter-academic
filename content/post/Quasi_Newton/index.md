title: Quasi-Newton method
subtitle: 

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Derive the formula of Quasi-Newton, such as DFP and BFGS. DFP may fail when the condition number of hessian lambda_max / lambda_min is very big, BFGS is more stable than DFP but someone gave an example that BFGS couldn't work for non-convex problems. In addition, we implemented the limit memory BFGS Quasi-Newton method.
