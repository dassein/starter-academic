abstract: In this paper, we propose computer vision techniques for 3D reconstruction and object height measurement using a single camera and multi-laser emitters which have an intersection on the projected image plane. Time-division and color division methods are first investigated. Although the color division method offers better accuracy for height measurement, it requires the laser emitters equipped with different color light, and the color division method is also sensitive to light exposure in the measurement environment. Next, a new multi-level random sample consensus (MLRANSAC) algorithm has been developed. The proposed MLRANSAC method not only offers high accuracy for height measurement but also eliminates the requirement for the laser emitters with different colors. Our experiment results have validated the effectiveness of the MLRANSAC algorithm.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Compared the proposed MLRANSAC method with time-division and color division methods, the experiment results validated the effectiveness of the MLRANSAC algorithm.
