I joined the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University West Lafayette](https://www.purdue.edu/) as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2021. I work as a research assistant at the [Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/) advised by [Prof. Edward J. Delp](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ace/). Prior to that, I obtained my MS degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [PNW](https://www.pnw.edu/) in 2021. Before that I received my BS degree in Telecommunication Engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bit.edu.cn/) in 2019. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and image processing.
